  - Register has them verity through Spotify first
  WORK ON: 
    - Upon return, grab User from localstorage for Username and email
      - Autofill forms
  - After registering, redirect to Home 

Small things: Add on "If you're a registed user..." and "If you'd like to register..." links

- If they click New Post when not Registered or Signed in:
  - Prompt them with a modal to either Register or Signin => Port them to Register or swap modal for Login 
  - If signed in, yet not verified, pop a modal up to verity through Spotify before making a new post 

Small change: Conditional Redirect: If no user or jwt, redirect to Register form; if user and jwt, redirect to New Post
