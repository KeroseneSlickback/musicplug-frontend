To do:

  - Change from independent children to parent holding state and handing down parts to display and intake from children
  - The issue is the children can't correctly update between children and parent, thus children to hand up everything to the parent.
  - Maybe a parent module with the children attached? Then that parent attached to the New post parent? 


  - New Post Page:
    Will hold the overall state of artist, album, and track info -- which is used to display the contents on the children.
    Tenitatively: Hold the searching functionality as well. 

  - Modules:
    Will display infomation relevant from saved state, alter state, and let users choose stuff.
    Has to recieve and push state from and to the parent.
